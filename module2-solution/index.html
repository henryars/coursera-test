The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.</p></div></div>

Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p></div></div>
